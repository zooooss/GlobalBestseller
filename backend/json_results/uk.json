Imagine that it lived under your roof and lolloped around your bedroom at night, drumming on the duvet cover when it wanted your attention. Imagine that, over two years later, it still ran in from the fields when you called it and snoozed in your house for hours on end and gave birth to leverets in your study. This happened to me.'\nWhen lockdown led busy professional Chloe to leave the city and return to the countryside of her childhood, she never expected to find herself custodian of a newly born hare. Yet when she finds the creature, abandoned, alone and no bigger than her palm, she is compelled to give it a chance at survival.\nRaising Hare chronicles their journey together and the challenges of caring for the leveret and preparing for its return to the wild. We witness first-hand an extraordinary relationship between human and animal, reconnecting with our childhood enthusiasm for wildlife. This improbable bond of trust serves to remind us that the most beautiful experiences, inspiring the most hope, arise when we least expect them.",

Now they bring you their debut book, all about the world’s worst maps. Some are decades old, some are centuries old, and some are so recent they’re still being published today (or yesterday, if you’re reading this tomorrow).\nThey include world maps, colonial maps, corporate maps, Soviet maps, pioneer maps, news maps and maps whose intended use was hijacked for a French surrealist political movement in the 1950s. Whether you’re an avid map junkie or simply ‘map-curious’, each chapter uncovers a unique tale of adventure, error and unexpected humour – as they attempt to answer the question: ‘What on earth happened here?’\nSo, ditch the compass (or disable location services) and set out into a world of cartographic chaos and mappy mishaps.\nBecause the worst maps are the best maps.",

    "description": "The extraordinarily powerful memoir by the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre, the inspirational woman who stood up and spoke out about serial abusers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThis is the memoir behind the headlines: intimate, fierce, unforgettable.\nIn 2011, Virginia Roberts Giuffre hit the headlines as Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s most outspoken victim: the woman whose decision to speak out helped send both serial abusers to prison and whose photograph with Prince Andrew catalysed his fall from grace.\nBut first and foremost, she became known as a voice of courage and resilience for women everywhere.\nThis is her story, in her own words.\nA story that has never been told in full before now.\nGiuffre’s story demonstrates with extraordinary power that victims are made, not born. And that once you come to truly understand the horrifying impact of abuse, you will never again question why a victim stays, or returns over and over again.\nIn April 2025, Giuffre took her own life. She left behind a memoir written in the years preceding her death and stated unequivocally that she wanted it published.\nThis is the powerful story of an ordinary girl who would grow up to confront adversity and trauma of the darkest form, yet found the strength to move forwards, reclaim her voice and shine a light on evil – advocating for others and fighting for a safer, fairer world.\nNobody’s Girl is a remarkable recounting of one woman’s fortitude in the face of depravity and despair, and the legacy she leaves behind.",
